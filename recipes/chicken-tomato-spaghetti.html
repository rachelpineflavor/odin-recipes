    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This tomato basil chicken pasta recipe is bursting with flavor and is pretty easy 
        to make. When you use in-season produce, you don’t need many extra ingredients. 
        The only ingredients in the sauce are the fresh tomatoes, sautéed with garlic and 
        seasoned with salt and pepper. I top it with fresh basil at the end.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless chicken breast halves (1 lb), diced in 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp each of dried oregano and dried basil</li>
        <li>kosher salt and fresh pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>8 oz spaghetti, gluten-free or whole wheat</li>
        <li>2 cups grape tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, smashed and coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>4 tsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tbsp chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.</li>
        <li>Season chicken generously with salt, pepper, oregano and basil.</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet on high heat. When hot, spray with oil and add 
            chicken. Cook about 3-4 minutes, until no longer pink.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add pasta and cook according to package directions. 
            Reserve about 1/2 cup pasta water before draining.</li>
        <li>While pasta cooks, add olive oil to skillet on high heat.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and sauté until golden brown (do not burn). Add 
            tomatoes, salt and pepper and reduce heat to medium-low. Sauté 
            about 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>When pasta is drained, add pasta to tomatoes and toss well. 
            If pasta seems too dry, add some of the reserved pasta water.</li>
        <li>Add fresh basil and chicken and toss well. Serve and top 
            with good grated cheese.</li>
    </ol>
