    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>Korean Beef Rice Bowls takes about 20 minutes 
        to whip up, so quick and easy, loaded with flavor!</p>
    <p>One essential ingredient you will need is Gochujang sauce. It’s a 
        Korean condiment that’s a little spicy and sweet, and has very distinct 
        flavor only found in Korean cuisine. It also comes in a paste which 
        requires you to thin it down.</p>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pound 93% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Gochujang, or more if desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons water, 
            brown sugar, sesame oil and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat a large deep nonstick skillet over high heat, spray with 
            oil and add the ground beef. Cook, breaking the meat up with 
            a wooden spoon until cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, garlic and ginger and cook 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the beef, cover and simmer on low heat 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>To assemble the bowls, place 3/4 cup rice in each bowl, top 
            with scant 2/3 cup beef, cucumbers, Gochujong, sesame 
            seeds and scallions.</li>
    </ol>
